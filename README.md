## Issue: Create freestyle application with source: 'Local cap project' failed 
The .env file is added and generated by binding locally a service. After is was generated the content of the file had to be converted to JSON. Otherwise the generation of a freestyle Fiori application failed by selecting source: "local CAP Project' in the wizzard. Also the BAS had to be restarted after the wizzard gave a error message during generation of the free style application.
